<p> "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken
 idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
 born and I will give you a complete account of the 
 system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
 explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
 No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because
 it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
 pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
 Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain 
 of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur 
 in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
 example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain 
 some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses 
 to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that 
 produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
